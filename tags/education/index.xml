      <description>Our new book chapter with Sezgin Ateş &amp;ldquo;Data Privacy in Digital Advertising: Towards a Post Third-Party Cookie Era&amp;rdquo; is published as a part of the new book series from Routledge: &amp;ldquo;Algorithms and Society&amp;rdquo;. The chapter analyzes the methods by which user behaviors are tracked online for the delivery of personalized advertising and have their personal data commodified in the marketplace. The technologies employed inevitably lead to privacy violations and regulations often do not keep up with the fast pace of these technical developments which allow for ever more effective web tracking and surveillance.</description>

      <description>I built this web site with Hugo and host it on Netlify. I use Visual Studio Code to make all the editing on my local repository and to push to/pull from my remote repository on GitHub. I&amp;rsquo;m a beginner so this process helped me alot to learn the basic of Markdown and Git. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to update the website content following these steps but sometimes it can be frustrating. At those times, I really miss the user interface of content management systems such as Wordpress.</description>

      <description>Enable APIs    The first step is to enable APIs on Google API Console. You need a Google account to do this.
 Click on +ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES Type &amp;lsquo;Youtube&amp;rsquo; on the search bar. You will see four options (Youtube Data API v3, Youtube Analytics API, Youtube Ads Reach API and Youtube Reporting API). Enable all of them.

      <description>I give theoretical and prectical lessons on advertising which is in a constant state of flux. Therefore, I always try to update the content of my courses to stay relevant.
