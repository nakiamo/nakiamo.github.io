      <description>I created a web site for &amp;ldquo;Cultural Studies &amp;amp; Gender, Sexuality, and Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies Graduate Student Organization&amp;rdquo; at the University of Pittsburgh.
https://cggso.netlify.app I used Hugo as the static website generator. The free Winston Theme was the right choice for the content. The student organziation organizes an annual graduate student conference so they needed a simple and effective conference schedule embedded on the website. After searching for the free and paid alternatives, I found out Time.</description>

      <title>New book chapter: Data privacy in digital advertising</title>

      <guid>https://nakiamo.github.io/posts/privacy-in-digital-advertising/</guid>
      <description>Our new book chapter with Sezgin Ateş &amp;ldquo;Data Privacy in Digital Advertising: Towards a Post Third-Party Cookie Era&amp;rdquo; is published as a part of the new book series from Routledge: &amp;ldquo;Algorithms and Society&amp;rdquo;. The chapter analyzes the methods by which user behaviors are tracked online for the delivery of personalized advertising and have their personal data commodified in the marketplace. The technologies employed inevitably lead to privacy violations and regulations often do not keep up with the fast pace of these technical developments which allow for ever more effective web tracking and surveillance.</description>

      <description>Reminder to myself
GitHub.com removed its support for password authentication on August 13, 2021. Now I need to use a personal access token instead on VS Code. These are the steps to setup GitHub auth. with personal access token:
Create personal access token on Github page: Settings / Developer Settings / Personal Access Tokens Set the current directory on command line to your Project root: 1 &amp;gt; cd C:\Users\MyProject Run this command: 1 2 &amp;gt; git remote set-url youroriginname https://yourusername:pastetokenhere@github.</description>

      <description>I built this web site with Hugo and host it on Netlify. I use Visual Studio Code to make all the editing on my local repository and to push to/pull from my remote repository on GitHub. I&amp;rsquo;m a beginner so this process helped me alot to learn the basic of Markdown and Git. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to update the website content following these steps but sometimes it can be frustrating. At those times, I really miss the user interface of content management systems such as Wordpress.</description>

      <description>RHI460 Advertising Project is aimed for senior students and an applied course where students develop innovative ideas that might serve the future needs and expectations of consumers. Eventually, they make video presentation of the project and submit it to Cannes Future Lions Creativity Competition. This year, I had to make some changes. First of all, I moved the class online but then I realized that it&amp;rsquo;s really hard when it&amp;rsquo;s not face to face.</description>

Click on +ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES Type &amp;lsquo;Youtube&amp;rsquo; on the search bar. You will see four options (Youtube Data API v3, Youtube Analytics API, Youtube Ads Reach API and Youtube Reporting API). Enable all of them.

      <description>Lately, I’ve been following the web site of Yale Institute for Network Science’s website Human Nature Lab. It’s a great source to follow the latest academic studies on networks. Even better, they develop and share open source software for all of us to use. One of them is, Trellis; a suite of software tools for conducting social network analysis, but today I would like to talk about Breadboard. It is a software for developing and conducting human interaction experiments on networks.</description>
