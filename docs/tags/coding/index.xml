      <description>I created a web site for &amp;ldquo;Cultural Studies &amp;amp; Gender, Sexuality, and Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies Graduate Student Organization&amp;rdquo; at the University of Pittsburgh.
https://cggso.netlify.app I used Hugo as the static website generator. The free Winston Theme was the right choice for the content. The student organziation organizes an annual graduate student conference so they needed a simple and effective conference schedule embedded on the website. After searching for the free and paid alternatives, I found out Time.</description>

      <description>Reminder to myself
GitHub.com removed its support for password authentication on August 13, 2021. Now I need to use a personal access token instead on VS Code. These are the steps to setup GitHub auth. with personal access token:
Create personal access token on Github page: Settings / Developer Settings / Personal Access Tokens Set the current directory on command line to your Project root: 1 &amp;gt; cd C:\Users\MyProject Run this command: 1 2 &amp;gt; git remote set-url youroriginname https://yourusername:pastetokenhere@github.</description>

      <description>I built this web site with Hugo and host it on Netlify. I use Visual Studio Code to make all the editing on my local repository and to push to/pull from my remote repository on GitHub. I&amp;rsquo;m a beginner so this process helped me alot to learn the basic of Markdown and Git. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to update the website content following these steps but sometimes it can be frustrating. At those times, I really miss the user interface of content management systems such as Wordpress.</description>

      <description>Enable APIs The first step is to enable APIs on Google API Console. You need a Google account to do this.
Click on +ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES Type &amp;lsquo;Youtube&amp;rsquo; on the search bar. You will see four options (Youtube Data API v3, Youtube Analytics API, Youtube Ads Reach API and Youtube Reporting API). Enable all of them. Type &amp;lsquo;Freebase API&amp;rsquo; on the search bar and enable it, too. Now all the APIs are enabled.</description>
